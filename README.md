# About this project

This repository of DeepRL source code is work of 2nd Project - Continuous Control in 
**[Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893)**

For this project, we work with the Unity ML-Agents Reacher Environment which is created by using Unity ML-Agents([github repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents))


# Project Details

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must
get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.

# Getting Started
After downloading the project files; create an environment from [Environment](./environment.yml) then follow the instructions.

Note: Additionally Unity ML-Agents to be installed by following instructions ([github repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents))
 
# Instructions
To train the agent, start jupyter notebook, open - [`Continuous_Control.ipynb`]( ./Continuous_Control.ipynb)
and execute! For more information, please check instructions
inside the notebook.

# Report
You can read the report to understand the implemented algorithm and hyperparameters better.
